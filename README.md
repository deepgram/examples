# examples

Agent-maintained examples showing how to use Deepgram SDKs with popular platforms, frameworks, and ecosystems.

**All examples are built and maintained by autonomous agents.** Humans can direct, override, and add examples at any time.

[→ Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) · [→ Open PRs](../../pulls) · [→ Suggest an example](../../issues/new/choose)

## How it works

1. **PM** — Discovers new integration opportunities weekly; accepts freeform suggestions from any GitHub issue
2. **Researcher** — Gathers platform SDK docs and credential requirements before building starts
3. **Engineer** — Builds the full integration (src/, tests/, .env.example, README) and opens a PR
4. **Lead — E2E** — Runs a real Deepgram API smoke test on every PR (STT + TTS)
5. **Lead — Review** — Checks code quality and verifies the integration is genuine (real SDK calls, not mocked)
6. **Lead — Fix** — If tests fail, investigates and repairs; retries up to 3 times before escalating
7. **Merge** — Once E2E passes and review is approved, the PR squash-merges automatically

PRs requiring partner credentials stay open with a `⏸` comment until secrets are configured. Every merged example has passed a real Deepgram API call.

## Numbering convention

Examples are numbered globally in increments of 10: `010`, `020`, `030` … A platform owns its group — a second Twilio example would be `021`, not a new slot. New platforms claim the next free multiple of 10.

## Language support

| Language | Test workflow | Marker file |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Node.js / TypeScript | `test-node.yml` | `package.json` |
| Python | `test-python.yml` | `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` |
| Go | `test-go.yml` | `go.mod` |
| Java | `test-java.yml` | `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` |

## Setup

1. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a repository secret — required for all agent workflows
2. Add `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` as a repository secret — required for E2E tests
3. Add partner credentials as needed (each example's `.env.example` lists them)
4. Enable **auto-merge** in repository Settings → General → Pull Requests

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically by GitHub Actions.

## Suggesting an example

Open any GitHub issue and write whatever you like — the PM agent reads it, figures out what you mean, and routes it. No template or label required.
