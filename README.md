# dx-examples

Agent-maintained examples showing how to use Deepgram SDKs with popular platforms, frameworks, and ecosystems.

**All examples are built and maintained by autonomous agents.** Humans can direct, override, and add examples at any time.

[→ Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) · [→ Open PRs](../../pulls) · [→ Request an example](../../issues/new/choose)

## How it works

1. **Discover** — Agents scan for new platforms and ecosystems weekly, queuing example ideas
2. **Create** — Agents build working example apps with tests and documentation, raising PRs
3. **Review** — Agents self-review their PRs; Copilot review also runs automatically
4. **Test** — Language-specific CI workflows run the example's tests
5. **Fix** — If tests fail for fixable reasons, the fix agent pushes a repair and tests retry
6. **Merge** — Auto-merge activates once all checks pass

If an example requires external credentials that aren't configured as repository secrets, the PR stays open with a comment tagging `@deepgram-devrel` listing exactly what's needed. Every example in the commit history represents a complete contribution → review → fix → merge lifecycle.

    README.md             # What it does, prerequisites, env vars, how to run
    .env.example          # Every required environment variable (no values)
    src/                  # Source code
    tests/                # Tests — must exit 0 on success, 1 on failure, 2 on missing credentials

## Numbering convention

Examples are numbered globally in increments of 10: `010`, `020`, `030` … The number appears as the directory name prefix. Gaps are intentional — they allow future insertions without renumbering.

## Language support

| Language | Test workflow | Marker file |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Node.js / TypeScript | `test-node.yml` | `package.json` |
| Python | `test-python.yml` | `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` |
| Go | `test-go.yml` | `go.mod` |
| Rust | `test-rust.yml` | `Cargo.toml` |
| .NET / C# | `test-dotnet.yml` | `*.csproj` |

## Setup

1. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a repository secret — required for all agent workflows
2. Add `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` as a repository secret — required for E2E tests
3. Add partner credentials as needed (each example's `.env.example` lists them)
4. Enable **auto-merge** in repository Settings → General → Pull Requests
5. Configure branch protection on `main` to require status checks before merging

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically by GitHub Actions.

## Running agents locally

```bash
# Requires: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set, gh auth login done, git configured
claude --model claude-opus-4-6 -p "$(cat instructions/discover-examples.md)"
claude --model claude-opus-4-6 -p "$(cat instructions/create-example.md)"
```
